# MetaBricks Revenue Share Economics

## Current Model: 90/10 Split

**432 bricks × $50 = $21,600 raised**  
**Get: 90% of all SC-Gen revenue (forever)**

## Issues & Alternatives

### Option 1: Increase NFT Supply (10,000 shares)
- Raise $500k instead of $21k
- Each holder gets smaller share (more sustainable)
- ROI still attractive: 14.4% yield

### Option 2: Reduce Split (60/40 or 70/30)
- Keep 432 bricks
- More treasury for operations
- Still great returns for holders

### Option 3: Tiered System (Recommended)
- Founder Bricks (432): 50% of revenue
- Builder Shares (5,000): 20% of revenue  
- Community Shares (10,000): 20% of revenue
- Treasury: 10%

### Option 4: Revenue Cap Per NFT
- Max 5 SOL/month per brick
- Excess to treasury as business scales

### Option 5: Hybrid (Top Recommendation)
- 432 founders get 50-60%
- Treasury gets 30-40%
- Room for future tiers
